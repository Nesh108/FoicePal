# FoicePal
Project for the BattleHack 2015, Berlin.

With the increase of self-service checkout in shops, many people are losing yet another chance to interact with another human being.
We want to bring this back with FoicePal: with the use of cutting-edge voice and face recognition technologies, the system will be able to recognize the customer with a high degree of precision and confidence (helped by the double authentication), the system will then converse with the customers during the checkout, if they so wish.
The authentication also helps to facilitate the purchase as now the customer has the option to pay directly with their PayPal account. They will be notified with an SMS about the request of transaction and the customer will then be able to authorize the payment.

This system also can be applied for online shopping and mobile shopping as well, bringing back the currently lost interaction between seller and buyer virtually anywhere.
